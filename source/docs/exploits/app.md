# Application-based

Common application-based attacks.

## Injection attacks

Injection attacks are one of the most common types of attacks against applications
today. Web applications are especially vulnerable because they are internet-facing and their audience is
extended out to the Internet.

## Authentication attacks

Authentication
attacks are methods you can use to try to bypass the authentication or compromise
the security of the application by cracking the application’s passwords.

## Authorisation attacks

After a user authenticates to an application or API,
the user is then authorised to perform different actions while using the application or API. A vulnerable application may not have authorization configured properly and
simply allows users and other applications to perform any task within the application.

## XSS and CSRF/XSRF attacks

Cross-site scripting, or XSS for short, is one of the most common vulnerabilities
found in web applications and involves the hacker injecting client-side script into
a web page that is then viewed and executed by others at a later time.

The goal of a CSRF/ XSRF attack is to get an unsuspecting user to submit data to a website the user has
already logged on to. A CSRF/XSRF attack leverages the fact that the site has
already authenticated the user to the site, and therefore trusts all actions from the
user.
