# Wireless

Common attack vectors and attacks to gain access to wireless.

## Eavesdropping

Many of the attacks on wireless networks involve eavesdropping, the process of capturing the traffic, making a copy of
it so that it can be read if it is not encrypted (or cracking the encryption key if it is encrypted).

## Data modification

With wireless networks, an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack (on-path attack), intercept
the traffic, and then modify the traffic before forwarding it on to the wireless access point.

## Data corruption

Data corruption attack methods involve altering or corrupting the data so that it is not readable by the
destination system.

## Relay attacks

A relay attack is the capturing of a wireless signal and sending it somewhere else. This type of attack is
commonly used to compromise vehicle key fobs. Using a special transmitter, an adversary can relay the signal from
the key fob of a car to a teammate who receives the relayed signal to open the door of the car.

## Spoofing

Spoofing refers to altering a source address, whether that is the source MAC address or source IP address of a
packet, or the source email address of an email message. It is a common phenomenon in wireless attacks for
bypassing MAC filtering on a wireless access point.
